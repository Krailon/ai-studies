Various tools &amp; experiments developed while studying Artificial Intelligence systems

## Current Research Areas
- Mechanistic Interpretability & Attribution
- Geometric Deep Learning
- Graph Representation Learning
- Large Language Models (primarily GPT for now)
- Training Optimization ("Effective Dimension" of activations via K. Ravichandran et al)

## Educational Tools
- MechaViz: Mechanistic Visualization of Neural Networks

## Planned Tools
- Dataset Analyzer: Identify useful attributes/metrics of datasets & procedurally suggest effective network architectures with parameter constraints
- GPT Decoder: Enumerate learned factual associations between tokens using Causal Tracing via K. Meng et al)
